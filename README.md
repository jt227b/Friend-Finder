## Website

## Getting Started

 Our site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Prerequisites 

1. Create a folder called FriendFinder.

2. Inside the folder, organize the directories so it matches the following:

```
        FriendFinder
            - .gitignore
            - app
            - data
                - friends.js
            - public
                - home.html
                - survey.html
            - routing
                - apiRoutes.js
                - htmlRoutes.js
            - node_modules
            - package.json
